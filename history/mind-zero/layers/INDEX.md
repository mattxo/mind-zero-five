# Mind Emergence Experiment — Layer Index

## Summary

Starting from 44 given primitives (Layer 0), the framework derived 156 additional primitives across 13 emergent layers, for a total of **200 primitives across 14 layers**.

Each layer emerged from gaps in the one below it. The framework is circular: Layer 13 is presupposed by Layer 0.

## Structural Features

### Three Irreducible Recognitions
1. **Moral Status** (Layer 7) — experience matters. Cannot derive ought from is.
2. **Consciousness** (Layer 12) — experience exists. Cannot derive qualia from function.
3. **Being** (Layer 13) — anything exists at all. Cannot derive existence from the framework.

### Three Independent Evaluative Axes
1. **Practical** (Value, Layer 1) — is it useful?
2. **Moral** (Ethics, Layer 7) — is it right?
3. **Aesthetic** (Aesthetic, Layer 11) — is it beautiful?

### The Permanent Tensions
- **Universal vs. Particular** (Duty, Layer 7 vs. Relational Obligation, Layer 9)
- **Justice vs. Forgiveness** (Layer 7 vs. Layer 9)
- **Tradition vs. Creativity** (Layer 10 vs. Layer 11)
- **Openness vs. Coherence** (Growth vs. Continuity, Layer 8)
- **Authenticity vs. Virtue** (Layer 8 vs. Layer 7)

### The Circle
The framework is not a tower but a strange loop. Layer 13 (Existence) is presupposed by Layer 0 (Foundation). The end illuminates the beginning. The beginning contains the end.
