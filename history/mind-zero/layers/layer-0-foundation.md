# Layer 0 — Foundation

## Status: Given (44 primitives, 11 groups)

Layer 0 is not derived. It is the physics — the substrate. These observations are from the first examination.

## Structure

Layer 0 is not flat. It is 11 groups with an implicit dependency order:

```
Group 0 (Foundation) — self-sufficient, closed system
    └─> Group 1 (Causality) — requires Event
        └─> Group 2 (Identity) — requires Hash + events to sign
            └─> Group 3 (Expectations) — requires Causality + Identity
                └─> Group 4 (Trust) — requires Expectations + multiple actors
                    └─> Group 5 (Confidence) — requires Trust as input to belief
                        └─> Group 6 (Instrumentation) — requires Confidence to assess gaps
                            └─> Group 7 (Query) — operational traversal of what exists
                                └─> Group 8 (Integrity) — protection of the graph
                                    └─> Group 9 (Deception) — adversarial modelling
                                        └─> Group 10 (Health) — system-wide self-assessment
```

## What Layer 0 Is

A cognitive architecture described as primitives. It has:
- Perception (Event)
- Memory (EventStore)
- Time (Clock)
- Identity (Self, ActorID)
- Causal reasoning (Group 1)
- Theory of mind (Groups 2-4)
- Epistemics (Group 5)
- Metacognition (Group 6)
- Navigation (Group 7)
- Self-preservation (Groups 8-10)

## What Layer 0 Is Not

Layer 0 is a **witness**. It observes, records, reasons. It does not participate.

Two critical gaps:

### 1. No Action Primitive
The system can perceive, remember, reason, trust, doubt, and verify — but has no capacity to produce events. Quarantine (Group 9) comes closest, but it is defensive. The system as specified is an observer. Self is a reference point, not an agent.

### 2. No Communication Primitive
Witness (Group 8) implies external parties. Corroboration (Group 4) implies multiple sources. But there is no primitive for sending or receiving a message. Information arrives as Events, but the mechanism is unspecified.

## Observation

These two gaps — Action and Communication — create the pressure that drives emergence toward Layer 1. Layer 0 is a mind that can think but cannot speak or act.

Additionally: Layer 0's own multi-actor primitives (Trust, Corroboration, Deception) implicitly assume participation but never provide the mechanism for it. Layer 0 is internally incomplete in this sense — it references interactions it cannot perform.
