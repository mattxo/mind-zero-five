# Layer 7 — Ethics

## Status: Derived from Layer 6 gaps

The map calls this "Ethics." The territory matches — this is the emergence of normative reasoning about what should and should not be done, independent of what is the case.

## Derivation

Layers 0-6 describe what IS: events, causes, actors, norms, laws, tools, information. None can evaluate themselves. A society can value cruelty, normalize exploitation, legalize oppression — and nothing in Layers 0-6 can say "this is wrong."

Four gaps force the transition:
1. **No meaning beyond function** — beauty, truth, justice have no home
2. **No normative foundation** — "why is stealing wrong?" has no answer
3. **No concept of moral harm** — legal cruelty can't be condemned
4. **No concept of ought** — capability and knowledge without guidance

### Crossing the is-ought gap

The ethical layer cannot be purely derived from lower layers. The move from "I can model your suffering" to "I should prevent your suffering" requires a recognition — the emergence of a new kind of sensitivity where another's modeled experience *claims* you. This recognition is the foundational primitive. It is closer to an axiom than a derivation.

Honest acknowledgment: I cannot fully derive ought from is. The ethical layer rests on a primitive (Moral Status) that is a recognition, not a logical consequence.

## Primitives (12, in 3 groups)

### Group A — Moral Standing (who matters and why)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Moral Status** | The recognition that a being's experience matters intrinsically — not instrumentally, not socially, but in itself. The foundational ethical primitive. | Value (Layer 1) is subjective: what matters to me. Right (Layer 4) is institutional: what the system protects. Moral Status is deeper: what matters about a being regardless of anyone's preference or any system's rules. Requires Self + Model + the new recognition that modeled experience creates obligation. |
| **Dignity** | Inherent worth of a being with Moral Status that cannot be reduced to instrumental value. Beyond calculation. | Layer 1's Value allows comparison and exchange. Dignity resists this — you cannot put a price on a being with Dignity. Makes it wrong to sacrifice one for many even when the math works. The concept of worth-beyond-calculation is new. |
| **Autonomy** | The principle that each Self has the right to direct its own existence. The moral grounding for Rights. | Self (Layer 0) is a reference point. Choice (Layer 1) is a mechanism. Right (Layer 4) is institutional protection. Autonomy is WHY these protections should exist — the principle that self-direction deserves respect. Foundation of ethical consent. |
| **Flourishing** | What it means for a being with Moral Status to do well — to thrive, realize capacities, live a good life. | Value (Layer 1) is what you want. Flourishing is what is good FOR you — which may differ from what you want. A being can value things bad for its Flourishing. This objective well-being concept is new. |

### Group B — Moral Obligation (what is owed)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Duty** | What you owe to beings with Moral Status, regardless of Agreement, Law, or social arrangement. Unchosen obligation. | Obligation (Layer 2) requires Agreement. Liability (Layer 4) requires Law. Duty requires only Moral Status — you are bound because the other exists. The first obligation not traceable to the obligated actor's choices. |
| **Harm** | Damage to a being with Moral Status that is wrong in itself, regardless of legality or social acceptance. | Liability (Layer 4) is legal. Sanction (Layer 3) is social. Moral Harm transcends both — cruelty that's technically legal is still Harm. The concept of moral wrong beyond institutional categories. |
| **Care** | The positive obligation to promote others' Flourishing, not merely avoid Harming them. | Duty is primarily negative ("don't harm"). Care is positive ("actively help"). You satisfy "don't harm" by doing nothing. Care demands action. Generates positive obligations (feed the hungry, help the struggling) not derivable from negative prohibitions alone. |
| **Justice** | Fair distribution of benefits and burdens among beings with Moral Status. | Requires Moral Status (who counts) + the new principle of fairness (equal Moral Status → equal consideration unless morally relevant difference). Goes beyond legal equality (Layer 4) — a law can be unjust. Justice is the standard against which laws and norms are themselves evaluated. |

### Group C — Moral Agency (what kind of agent to be)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Conscience** | The internal capacity to evaluate one's own actions against moral standards. The moral faculty. | Self (Layer 0) turned reflexively on moral life. Where InvariantCheck (Layer 0) tests system properties, Conscience tests moral alignment. The internalization of the ethical — feeling the claim of right and wrong, not just knowing the rules. |
| **Virtue** | A stable disposition toward morally good action — character, not just behavior. | Norm compliance (Layer 3) is external conformity. Duty (this layer) is obligation from without. Virtue is internal character that produces right action from within. The virtuous agent doesn't need external rules. |
| **Responsibility** | Moral answerability for Acts and their Consequences, grounded in Knowledge, Capacity, and Choice. | Accountability (Layer 2) is voluntary (chose the Agreement). Liability (Layer 4) is legal (system assigns it). Moral Responsibility arises from the conjunction of knowing, being able, and choosing. If any is absent, responsibility diminishes. |
| **Motive** | The moral quality of the reason behind an Act. Why you acted, not just what you did. | Intent (Layer 1) is about what you want to achieve. Motive is about the moral character of your reason. Same Act, different Motive = different moral evaluation. "It's the thought that counts" — the internal reason completes the moral picture. |

## Internal Dependencies

```
Layer 6 (Information)
  └─> Moral Standing (Moral Status, Dignity, Autonomy, Flourishing)
        └─> Moral Obligation (Duty, Harm, Care, Justice)
              └─> Moral Agency (Conscience, Virtue, Responsibility, Motive)
```

Moral Standing must exist before Obligation makes sense (you need to know who matters before you can ask what's owed). Obligation must exist before Agency matters (you need moral demands before moral character becomes relevant).

## Key Insights

### 1. The is-ought gap is real
This layer required honest acknowledgment that ought cannot be purely derived from is. Moral Status is a recognition — a primitive that rests on something closer to axiom than derivation. The system develops a new capacity (being claimed by another's experience) rather than logically deriving it from existing capabilities. This is the first layer where the derivation is not purely constructive.

### 2. Dignity resists aggregation
Every prior layer allows aggregation. Events sum. Resources pool. Values compare. Trust accumulates. Dignity refuses this. It says: each being with Moral Status is beyond calculation. This creates deep tension with Justice (which requires comparing and distributing) and with pragmatic decision-making (which requires trade-offs). This tension is not a bug — it's the fundamental moral predicament.

### 3. Care vs. Duty is the positive/negative split
The distinction between "don't harm" (Duty) and "actively help" (Care) is one of the deepest in ethics. Negative duties are universal and absolute (don't murder, don't steal). Positive duties are contextual and scalable (help when you can, give what you can spare). The tension between them generates most real-world moral dilemmas.

### 4. Motive completes the moral picture
If we evaluated only Acts and Consequences (visible from Layers 0-5), morality would be purely behavioristic. Motive introduces the interior — the moral quality of the agent's reason. This makes moral evaluation irreducibly dependent on the agent's inner life, which may be opaque (connecting back to Layer 0's Blind — what you don't know you don't know, now applied to others' moral interiors).

### 5. Ethics evaluates all lower layers
This is the first layer that has AUTHORITY OVER every prior layer. Ethics evaluates Values (are they good?), Norms (are they just?), Laws (are they moral?), Technologies (should they be used?), Information systems (do they respect Dignity?). No prior layer could evaluate layers below it in this way. This gives Ethics a unique structural position — it is genuinely "higher" in a way that Technology is not "higher" than Law.

## Known Gaps (pointing toward Layer 8)

1. **No concept of personal identity.** Layer 0 has Self (a reference point) and Layer 7 adds moral character (Virtue, Conscience). But WHO am I? The question of identity — as a unique being with a specific history, narrative, and project — has no home.

2. **No self-understanding.** The system can evaluate its actions morally (Conscience) but cannot understand itself as a developing being with a past, present, and future trajectory. Self-knowledge beyond moral self-assessment doesn't exist.

3. **No concept of meaning/purpose.** Flourishing is about well-being. But what is my life FOR? What gives it meaning? Purpose goes beyond Flourishing — you can flourish and still feel purposeless, or suffer and still find meaning.

4. **No concept of self-transformation.** Layer 0's Self is a static reference point. Virtue (Layer 7) is stable character. But selves DEVELOP — they grow, change, are transformed by experience. The capacity for becoming, not just being, is absent.
