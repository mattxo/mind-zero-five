# Layer 5 — Technology

## Status: Derived from Layer 4 gaps

The map calls this "Technology." The territory matches, broadly understood — this layer includes both systematic knowledge generation (science) and practical capability creation (engineering/technology). The Greek "techne" — skill, craft, systematic art — captures the breadth.

## Derivation

Layers 0-4 create a mind that can observe, reason, act, cooperate, organize, and govern. But it cannot build. It cannot extend its own capabilities. It cannot systematically investigate reality. The system can govern but has nothing to govern with.

Four gaps force the transition:
1. **No mechanism** — Law says what, never how
2. **No knowledge system** — no method for investigating reality
3. **No scale** — enforcement assumes capabilities the legal system can't generate
4. **No innovation** — the system responds to problems but never proactively extends capability

## Primitives (12, in 3 groups)

### Group A — Investigation (how reality is understood)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Method** | Systematic procedure for generating reliable knowledge through deliberate testing. Hypothesis → test → evidence → revision. | Layer 0 passively observes events. Method actively interrogates reality. The concept of creating conditions specifically to distinguish between possibilities is new. |
| **Measurement** | Systematic quantification of observation. Reduces qualitative experience to precise, comparable, communicable quantities. | Layer 0's Evidence is qualitative. Measurement makes it rigorous. Requires Tool (instrument) + Term (shared units) + the concept of quantification, which is absent from all prior layers. |
| **Knowledge** | Verified, generalizable, cumulative understanding. The output of Method. | Layer 0 has Evidence (specific) and Confidence (degree of certainty). Knowledge generalizes beyond instances, is verified through Method, builds on prior Knowledge. A different kind of epistemic object. |
| **Model** | A deliberately simplified representation of reality that enables prediction. | Layer 0's Expectations are pattern-based. Models are constructed, may predict things never observed, and deliberately accept information loss for usability. The concept of strategic simplification for prediction is new. |

### Group B — Creation (how capability is extended)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Tool** | An artifact that extends an actor's Capacity beyond inherent limits. Persists through repeated use (unlike Resource, which is consumed). | Introduces the recursive loop: Capacity → Tool → Greater Capacity → Better Tool → ... This self-amplifying quality is absent from all prior layers. Trust accumulates, Precedent aggregates, but nothing else expands fundamental capability. |
| **Technique** | A defined sequence of Acts that reliably produces a desired outcome. Practical knowledge — how to do something. | Protocol (Layer 2) structures communication. Technique structures practical action. Sharable through Signal — once communicated, others can replicate. The basis of teaching and cumulative practical culture. |
| **Invention** | Creation of a new Tool or Technique that didn't previously exist. Generative — brings novelty into being. | Everything prior operates on what exists. Invention produces what was not. Requires Gap (Layer 0) + Intent (Layer 1) + Method + Act. The concept of creating genuine novelty is new. |
| **Abstraction** | Deliberately reducing complexity by ignoring irrelevant details. Accepting information loss for usability. | Layer 0 has SubgraphExtract (subset extraction) and Annotate (adding meaning). Full Abstraction is more general: strategic simplification that makes complex reality tractable. Underlies both Models (conceptual) and Tools (physical — hiding complexity behind a simpler interface). |

### Group C — Systems (how technology scales)

| Primitive | Definition | Derivation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Persistent, shared systems extending group capability. Shared, persistent, enabling, networked. | Tool is individual. Infrastructure is collective — roads, irrigation, networks. Applies Technology at the scale of Layer 3's Society. The concept of shared enabling systems is new. |
| **Standard** | Agreed specification enabling independently created artifacts to work together. Interoperability. | Protocol (Layer 2) structures communication. Standard structures technical compatibility. When two builders follow the same Standard, their work is combinable. Technical interoperability is a new concept. |
| **Efficiency** | Systematic optimization of the Value-to-Resource ratio in a process. | Not just Choice (Layer 1, selecting among options) but deliberate process improvement — adjusting the means, not just the ends. Requires Measurement + Technique + Value + the concept of systematic optimization. |
| **Automation** | Using a Tool to execute a Technique without continuous actor involvement. An artifact that acts. | Extends Tool from "assists me" to "acts for me." Water wheels, clocks, traps. Introduces artifacts that behave like actors in limited ways — blurs the Tool/Actor boundary. No Intent, no Self, but produces Acts and Consequences. |

## Internal Dependencies

```
Layer 4 (Legal)
  └─> Investigation (Method, Measurement, Knowledge, Model)
        └─> Creation (Tool, Technique, Invention, Abstraction)
              └─> Systems (Infrastructure, Standard, Efficiency, Automation)
```

Note: Investigation and Creation are more tightly coupled than previous layers' groups. Method needs Tools (instruments), Tools need Knowledge (to design well). The dependency is primarily: you need to understand reality before you can reliably extend capability, and you need both before you can scale.

## Key Insights

### 1. The recursive engine
Tool is the most consequential primitive in this layer. It introduces a self-amplifying loop: use current capability to create artifacts that increase future capability. This recursion — absent from all prior layers — is the engine of all technological progress and the reason technological change accelerates.

### 2. Automation blurs actor/artifact
Every prior layer maintains a clean boundary: actors (have Identity, Intent, Self) and everything else. Automation introduces artifacts that perform Acts and produce Consequences without being actors. A water wheel has no Intent, but it grinds grain. A trap has no Self, but it captures prey. This boundary erosion becomes increasingly significant in higher layers (ultimately leading to artificial intelligence — Tools that appear to have Selves).

### 3. Knowledge is the only indefinitely renewable Resource
Resources (Layer 1) are finite and depletable. Knowledge is not — sharing it doesn't diminish it, and generating new Knowledge creates more possibilities for further Knowledge. This makes Knowledge fundamentally different from all other Resources and explains why knowledge-intensive societies operate differently from resource-intensive ones.

### 4. Technology enables all prior layers to scale
Without Technology:
- Trust (Layer 0) is limited to personal experience
- Exchange (Layer 2) is limited to face-to-face barter
- Society (Layer 3) is limited to Dunbar-number groups
- Legal systems (Layer 4) are limited to oral tradition

Technology provides the capability substrate that allows every prior layer to operate beyond its inherent scale limits.

## Known Gaps (pointing toward Layer 6)

1. **No Information as substance.** Layer 5 generates Knowledge and enables Measurement, but information itself — as something that can be stored, transmitted, compressed, encrypted, copied, corrupted — has no primitive. Information's properties as a "thing" are unaddressed.

2. **No Symbolic Systems.** Writing, mathematics, notation. These extend communication and knowledge beyond physical presence and individual memory. Layer 2's Terms are conceptual; persistent symbolic representation is not addressed.

3. **No Communication Infrastructure.** Signal (Layer 1) is point-to-point. Infrastructure (Layer 5) is physical. Systems for storing, transmitting, and retrieving information at scale — libraries, postal systems, networks — don't exist as concepts.

4. **No Computation.** Automation delegates physical Technique execution. But the manipulation of symbols according to rules — information processing — is distinct from physical automation and enables entirely new capabilities.
